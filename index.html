          <h2>So why your own website? </h2>
          <p>Mainly so I can show of what I can do and it be placed within a localised place</p>
          <p>It would still be shown off within twitter and maybe facebook but it gets lost within the noise of eveyone else</p>
        </section>
        <section class="third">
          <h2>Why HTML and CSS and not a website maker</h2>
          <p>2 reasons really. </p>
          <p>The main reason is because its a skill that I have been learning on and off for a while now and it kinda shows it off. </p>
          <p>The second reason is the website builders just get on my nerves, while a great tool and great for many its just not for me</p>
