          <h2>So why your own website? </h2>
          <p>Mainly so I can show of what I can do and it be placed within a localised place</p>
          <p>It would still be shown off within twitter and maybe facebook but it gets lost within the noise of eveyone else</p>
        </section>
        <section class="third">
          <h2>Why HTML and CSS and not a website maker</h2>
          <p>2 reasons really. </p>
          <p>The main reason is because its a skill that I have been learning on and off for a while now and it kinda shows it off. </p>
          <p>The second reason is the website builders just get on my nerves, while a great tool and great for many its just not for me</p>

        <section class="forth">
          <h2>Will this go to Github and can I help out at all?</h2>
          <p>It will go to Github just when I feel it is ready for it and while I like HTML and CSS im not the best at it so feel free to chip in and have a play</p>
