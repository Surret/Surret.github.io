        <p>Ok so it's been a while</p>
        <p>I Managed to make a few things but I feel the need to share this one that I'm proud of.</p>
        <img src="image/Rapid Racking Hook.png" class="stand">
        <p>Behold the Rapid Racking Hook!</p>
        <p>Well it just a hook that the pegs on the back of it but its quite affective for what I needed. The idea was to hang some sound dampening headphones which is very affective.</p>
        <p>This is designed the shelving holes for <a href=https://www.rackingsolutions.co.uk>rapid racking</a>which is designed to be like key holes.</p>
        <p>It fits a little loosely but that is just in case it need to move to another location</p>
        <p>With using Cura slicer made sure that the wall layer's set to 5 and infill wall's to 2 just to have some strength..... ok a lot of strength but I'm very much aware that the weak points are the pegs on the back that hook on the shelving.</p>
        <p>Also you might note that there is a block on the back where the pegs are. That is some support which is connected by a very small 1mm point just to get it over to Cura without issue.</p>
        <p>I did try to use the supports in Cura but it would not print well at all and the pegs needed to fit correctly within the racking</p>
        <p>After the first time printing it I saw that it was warping at the corners which is why the mouse ears on those points in the picture.</p>
        <img src="image/hook showing pegs.jpg" class="image2"><img src="image/hook on racking.jpg" class="image">
        <p>Honestly its quite affective. its been there for about 3 weeks now and no issues what so ever.</p>
        <p>Now to figure out what else to print.</p>
