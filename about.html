          <h1>Who am I</h1>
          <p>The simple answer someone that just likes figuring out and learning skills</p>
        </section>
        <section class="second">
          <h2>The Long answer?</h2>
          <p>Since I was young just felt the need to either investigate or at least figure out how things work.</p>
          <p>Which will be the reason I know HTML and CSS, its also the reason I started learning electronics and computer programs when I was a child, they just fasinate me</p>
          <p>If its something I feel that I looks intresting I will be learning about it tech know technical or not</p>
        </section>
        <section class="third">
          <h2>Why have I not heard of you sooner?</h2>
          <p>That will be my own fault i'm not good a promoting myself or even talking about what I can do...</p>
          <p>What can I say talking about my skills and what I can do is not easy to me</p>
          <p>Which is why I have made this website so I can show who wants to know me can find my work just that little bit easier</p>
        </section>
        <section class="forth">
          <h2>What can you do?</h2>
          <p>My area of expertise is electronics which is something I have been intrested in for a long time.</p>
          <p>But I have also been intresting anything related to computers which ment when I was young the intrest was into the software and the programming side of things.</p>
